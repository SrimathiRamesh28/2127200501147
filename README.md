This application is developed using android studio with java code. The voter's voter ID and other information will
be stored in the database. The verification is handled internally by the server. A One Time Password will then be
sent to the voter's registered cellphone number to further verify their ability to cast a ballot. The voter is permitted
to cast their ballot following a successful One Time Password authentication.
